    <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
    <p style="color:gray">I really miss when my dad was still in it. I've still been struggling with my newfound loneliness for the past two weeks. I hear that I should keep myself busy for the sake of distraction, but that feels wrong to me. Other than my education and basic life needs, I need to find some good things to be occupied with. <em>So</em>, <b>I will list three traits I believe I inherited from my dad:</b></p>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precalculus">My competence in mathematics that is Calculus-1 or lower</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/">My interest in reading</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://www.pinterest.com">My appreciation for arts and culture</a></li>
    </ul>
    <p style="color:darkorange">The most memorable metropolitan vacations I had with my dad along with the rest of my family were in:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Italy</li>
        <li>France</li>
        <li>Japan</li>
    </ol>
